localizedName: "[#ffec6e]Solar Flare"
description:
'''
A cousin of the Meltdown. Heavily damages blocks and inflicts a status effect that completely melts units. Fires a little slower than an avarage Meltdown.

MEEP went mad with power so it has a few extra beams.

And now with 6.0, it's unscripted! :D
